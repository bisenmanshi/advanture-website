            <h2 class="desc">PARAGLIDING</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is a recreational and competitive sport that involves flying in a lightweight,
                 foot-launched aircraft known as a paraglider. The pilot sits in a harness suspended beneath 
                 a fabric wing, which is inflated by the wind. The wind shape is determined by lines and a framework
                  of ribs, similar to a parachute. Paragliding is launched by running down a slope with the wing overhead,
                   or by being towed behind a vehicle. Once airborne, the pilot can control the wing's direction and speed 
                   by shifting their body weight and using steering lines. Paragliding is a relatively easy sport to learn,
                    but it does require some physical fitness and training to be able to fly safely and confidently. 
                    The sport can be enjoyed by people of all ages and provides a unique perspective of the world as well
                     as a sense of freedom and tranquility. Paragliding is also a competitive sport, with pilots competing
                      in cross-country, acrobatic, and distance flying events.

                    <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2> 
                    <p class="text">
                        Surfing is a popular water sport that involves riding on the surface of a wave while standing
                         on a surfboard. It is typically done in the ocean, but can also be done in other bodies of water
                          with suitable wave conditions. Surfing originated in Hawaii and has since spread to coastal
                           communities around the world. It requires a combination of strength, balance, 
                           and technique to successfully ride a wave. Surfers typically use a combination of paddling 
                           and pop-ups to catch and ride a wave. The sport can be enjoyed by people of all ages, 
                           but it does require a certain level of physical fitness and skill to be able to catch and 
                           ride a wave. The surfer community is known for its laid-back and adventurous culture.
                            Overall, surfing is a fun and challenging way to enjoy the ocean and the thrill of riding
                             a wave.
